<h3><a name="aim"></a>Aim of project</h3>
<p>To determine the Nasal carriage and Epidemiology of <i>Methicillin Resistant staphilococcus aureus,</i><b>MRSA,</b> Among apparently healthy Pharmacy students of the University of Benin, Benin City, Nigeria.</p>
<h3><a name="method"></a>Methods</h3>
<p>Nasal swabs collected from 200 randomly selected students within the ages of 18 to 38 years were used for the study. Isolates from the swabs were asceptically collected and characterised using standard microbiological methods, which included growth and fermentation on Mannitol Salt Agar
(MSA), Colonial Morphology, Gram-staining reaction and Biochemical tests, Antimicrobial susceptibility test were performed on Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) by modifoed kirby-Bauer disc difussion method</p>
<h3><a name="results"></>Results</h3>
<P>S.aureus was isolated in 49.5% (n=99) of the 200 nasal swabs. Among these Isoltes, 43% were from male students and 22.2% (n=22) were <em>MRSA.</em> The <b>MRSA</b> isolates indicated relatively high resistance to penicillins, moderate reistance to erythromycin and cefuroxime, and at least resistance to Gentamicin, Streptomycin, Cefuroxime, Ceftriaxone, Ciprofloxacin and Co-trimoxaxole. There was
 significant difference in terms of the colonization of S. aureus(P less than0.005) </p>
<h3><a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3>
<p> Many apparently healthy Pharmacy students of the faculty of pharmacy, University of Benin, Benin city, Nigeria, are nasal carriers of <b>MRSA.</b> The need for rational Chemotherapy, routine detection and regular surveilance of <b>MRSA</b> to limit its spread and reduce treatment failures is vital.</p>
